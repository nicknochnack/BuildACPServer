  The agent does stuff using smolagents.

  ## How It Works
  The agent follows a structured workflow to perform iterative web research and summarization:

  - **Runs a Query**: Does query stuff
  - **Web Research**: Searches the web smolagents CodeAgent base tools
  - **Finalization**: Consolidates all gathered insights and sources into a structured summary.

  The agent loops through steps 2–4 until the research loop limit is reached.

  ## Input Parameters
  - **prompt** (string) – The topic to research.

  ## Key Features
  - **Iterative Research Process** – Automatically refines queries and expands knowledge.
  - **Multi-Source Information Gathering** – Supports Tavily, DuckDuckGo, and Perplexity APIs.
  - **LLM-Powered Summarization** – Generates coherent and well-structured summaries.
  - **Automated Query Refinement** – Identifies knowledge gaps and adjusts queries dynamically.

  ## Use Cases
  - **Market Research** – Automates data gathering for competitive analysis.
  - **Academic Research** – Summarizes recent findings on a specific topic.
  - **Content Creation** – Gathers background information for articles, blogs, and reports.
  - **Technical Deep Dives** – Explores emerging technologies with structured, iterative research.
